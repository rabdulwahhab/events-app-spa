Web Dev Spring 2021 HW09 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Rayyan Abdi

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/boqolo/events-app-spa

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

events-spa.measuringworm.com

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

It mirrors the given user story save for the deep linking for an
unregistered user. Apart from that the functionality is mainly there
but I will say that I had a lot of trouble integrating ownership
access so controls are not very tight on who can edit what resources.

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

It is properly deployed. The only slight issue is external routing
which currently redirects all explicit requests from the address bar
that are not route to the home page irrespective of route parameters.
